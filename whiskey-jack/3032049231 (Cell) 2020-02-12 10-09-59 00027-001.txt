KENZIE:  Hello? 

OWEN: Hi, Kenzie. 

KENZIE: Oh, how's it going?

OWEN: Not great. I'm at the supplier and there's something wrong with our purchase order. 

KENZIE: Oh, what's the problem? 

OWEN: They said that the payment didn't go through in the last order. 

KENZIE: That's weird. I'll take a look into it and get back to you. 

OWEN: Okay. Want me to head to the Santos place? 

KENZIE: Uh, yes. I'll talk to you later, okay? Bye. 

OWEN: Okay, bye.
