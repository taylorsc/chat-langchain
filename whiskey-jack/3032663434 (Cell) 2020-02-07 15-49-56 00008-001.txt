EVIE: Hello?

KENZIE: Hi, this is Kenzie Hawk calling you back from the Eagles Maintenance and Landscaping Company. 

EVIE: Oh, yes, that's right. I know who you are. 

KENZIE: Oh, how do you know about us? 

EVIE: Oh, my friend Mildred from book club. She said you guys do great work with snow removal and lawn care. 

KENZIE: Oh, that's great to hear. We heard that you requested a quote for year-round service 

EVIE:  Oh, yes, yes. Well, I'm going away, you know, to Arizona and I'm going to need, you know, the snow taken care of, but I have a pretty big yard and it's too much work. 

KENZIE: Okay, yeah. Well, that's no problem for us. We can definitely do large lawns and driveways and everything. We can give you a quote over email if you would like. 

EVIE: Yeah, that's probably the way to go. I guess you could pull that from your website. 

KENZIE: Yeah. Just going to confirm your last name.  Yes, it's Santos, Evie Santos. Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Santos. Okay, thank you very much. You're welcome. Okay, bye-bye. 

EVIE: Bye.
