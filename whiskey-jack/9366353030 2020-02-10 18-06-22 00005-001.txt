KERI:  Eagle's Maintenance and Landscaping. 

SPEAKER_00: Hi, this is Mary Jo Stommel. Who am I speaking with? 

KERI: This is Keri. 

SPEAKER_00: Okay, I just wanted to find out when you guys were coming to do my yard. I know it's this week, but I can't quite remember. I'm having a party Friday night, and I want the yard to be looking good. 

KERI: Hold on a second, Mrs. Stommel, and let me check. 

SPEAKER_00: Okay, thanks. Whatever's easier. 

KERI: Let me see. Actually, Friday's fairly busy, so my best guess is they have to bring some plants and pots just to add to your garden. They don't know they have time to do any planting. 

SPEAKER_00:  No, no. I have quite a lovely blooming garden. I was just thinking of some little extras. 

KERI: Let me mention it to the crew supervisor and see what he can come up with. 

SPEAKER_00: I'd really appreciate it. And of course, I realize there would be an extra charge. 

KERI: Well, we'll see what we can do. 

SPEAKER_00: OK, thanks. 

KERI: You're welcome. Bye. Bye.
