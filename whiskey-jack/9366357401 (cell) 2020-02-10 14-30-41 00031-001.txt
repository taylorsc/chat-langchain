SHERRY:  Hello. 

BENNY: Hi. What are you doing? 

SHERRY: Just running some errands. What are you doing? 

BENNY: Gosh, well, we've had a pretty busy day today. Seems like everybody wants their yard landscaped at the same time. 

SHERRY: Sounds like money to me. 

BENNY: Yeah, but it's got us running in circles. Hey, listen, I'm going to go meet Ted for a few beers tonight, OK? 

SHERRY: OK. Tonight's my night for Curve, so I won't be home until later anyway. 

BENNY: Oh, right. I forgot. Good. 

SHERRY: How late will you be? 

BENNY: I'll be home by 7, because Fred and Ted are coming over for a meeting. 

SHERRY: All righty, then. I'll see you later. Bye. 

BENNY: Bye, sweetie.
