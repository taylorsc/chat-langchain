TINA:  All terrain. Tina speaking. May I help you? 

KERI: Hi, this is Keri with Eagles Maintenance and Landscaping. I'd like to place an order for two Sago palms to be picked up later in the week or sometime next week. 

TINA: Did you say you're with a landscaping company? 

KERI: Yes, in Cypress, Texas, which is right outside Houston. We've bought from y'all before. 

TINA: Okay, what size palms? 

KERI: Small ones. 

TINA: They run about $45 a piece, and that's with a discount since you're a landscaping company. 

KERI: Okay, that's fine. 

TINA:  Why don't I give you our fax number and you can send me an order for these two palms along with your company tax ID number. 

KERI: That'll work. 

TINA: You can just send it to my attention. Our fax number is 954-565-6452. Okay, thanks. 

KERI: I'll get it right out. 

TINA: All right. Please include on there who's going to pick it up and the estimated date. If I have any questions, I'll give you a call. 

KERI: Okay. Thank you. 

TINA: Thank you. Goodbye.
