FREDDY:  Hello? 

BENNY: Hey, how'd you do on the game last night? 

FREDDY: I did pretty good, which makes me even. 

BENNY: Yep, me too. Placed my bet and then got a real good feeling about it and decided to up it a bit. By the time I called back, the game had started and they wouldn't let me bump it. 

FREDDY: Bad luck, dude. 

BENNY: Oh, I would've made money if I'd paid more attention. 

FREDDY: Oh, well. You still did good, right? 

BENNY: Oh, yeah, yeah. I just could've done better. Okay, well, I'll be leaving for the shop in a bit, so I'll see you then. 

FREDDY: Yep, I'm already here, so come on. I've already got two crews out. 

BENNY: Okay, bye.
