BENNY:  Yes? 

BILLY: Hey, if I don't get to meet y'all tonight, give me a call after y'all meet and tell me what y'all discussed. 

BENNY: Okay. 

BILLY: By the way, I told Carrie to order a couple of Sago Palms from out there a place in South Florida. 

BENNY: Hey, you're so damn goofy. I don't think we need to go that extreme, but whatever. Did you get a chance to call that guy down south to find out the status of things? 

BILLY: No, I hadn't yet, but I will. 

BENNY: Call him now and call me back, because if you have an update, I'll know what to tell Freddy. 

BILLY: Okay, give me a minute, because Shrek's almost over and Caleb's just about asleep.  

BENNY: Okay, call me back. Bye!
