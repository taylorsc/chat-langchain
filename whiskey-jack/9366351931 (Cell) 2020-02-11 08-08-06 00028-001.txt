TED:  Yeah, go ahead. 

BILLY: Let's get that trailer loaded behind Fred's truck. He's gonna take it down south with him on this bogus journey. 

TED: What? 

BILLY: You know, the smaller trailer. I'm gonna order more Sagos and he'll need that trailer. 

TED: Why the hell do you need more Sagos? We got plenty. 

BILLY: I just think it's a good idea, that's all. Get one of the workers to put it behind Fred's truck. 

TED: I don't think you need it, but okay. 

BILLY: Just do it. Bye.
