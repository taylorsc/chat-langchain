RICHARD:  Hello? 

TBI-B: Hey, is this Richard? 

RICHARD: Yep. 

TBI-B: Hey, that's me. So, how's it going? 

RICHARD: It's going well, you? 

TBI-B: Good, good. I need you to go see the big man for me. 

RICHARD: Okay, what, same place as last time? 

TBI-B: Yeah, same place. Should be there at the same time as normal. 

RICHARD: All right. 

TBI-B: Just go and see him and take care of it, all right? 

RICHARD: All right, sounds good. 

TBI-B: Okay. Let me know when you're done. 

RICHARD: Yeah, will do. Bye. Later.
