BILLY:  Whatcha want? 

BENNY: Hey, whatcha doin'? 

BILLY: Me and Caleb are watchin' Shrek. Heh, funny movie. 

BENNY: Kay, well, I just, uh, wanna let you know that me and Ted are gonna have beers and hamburgers at Henry's Hideout before meetin' Freddy at my house at seven. If you get loose. 

BILLY: Sounds like a plan to me. If I do, I'll be there. 

BENNY: Okay, bye. 

BILLY: Later.
