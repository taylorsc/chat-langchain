BILLY: Good morning.

KERI: Morning. Benny just called. He's going to stop and get donuts. When are you getting here? 

BILLY: In just a little while. Hey, I think I want to increase that Sago Palm order from two to six. You think you can handle that? 

KERI: Sure. It's just a matter of sending out another order and cutting another check for the difference in the amount. 

BILLY: You're the best. 

KERI: That's what they tell me. 

BILLY: See you in a few. Bye. 

KERI: Bye.
