KENZIE: Hi, Owen.

OWEN: Hi, Kenzie. 

KENZIE: So I straightened out the issue with the supplier. We're good to go now. When you get the rocks out, swing by Mildred's place. She said we can store some stuff in her shed. You show her the key. 

OWEN: All right. 

KENZIE: I also sent you the updated customer list and service schedule. 

OWEN: OK. See you later. 

KENZIE: Thanks. Bye.
