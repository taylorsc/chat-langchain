RAY:  Hi. 

KERI: Hi, I'm Keri, Bill's niece. I also work for a company in Ajardinal. 

RAY: Yes. 

KERI: Bill asked me to call you because he wants Fred's number. Fred is the man who's going to find you. Okay. His number is 9798302271. Okay. He's leaving Texas today and he's going to Florida. 

RAY:  Bueno. Gracias. 

KERI: De nada. Y si hay problemas, llama a Bill o Ben. 

RAY: Gracias. Adios. 

KERI: Adios.
