BENNY:  Hello? 

BILLY: Hey, I just talked to Ray and he's going tomorrow, so we're set. 

BENNY: Good, good. How much? 

BILLY: He doesn't know yet. He said he called from Columbia. 

BENNY: Oh, good, good. 

BILLY: So when y'all meet with Fred tonight, make sure he's ready to go, probably tomorrow. 

BENNY: Uh, why's it so soon if Ray isn't going to Columbia until tomorrow? 

BILLY: I don't know how he's getting the stuff back. I didn't ask, but he said he'd be back with it the day after tomorrow. You figure a day and a half of driving, and we don't want Freddy hurrying. 

BENNY: That right. Last thing we need is for our money to disappear from some stupid traffic stop. 

BILLY: Exactly. So work on that and let me know. 

BENNY:  Okay, bye. 

BILLY: Bye.
