RAY:  Hello? 

BILLY: Hey, Ray, my friend. This is Bill in Houston. How are you? 

RAY: I'm fine, my friend. How are you? 

BILLY: Well, I'm getting anxious to meet with you. 

RAY: I understand. I understand. I, too, am anxious. 

BILLY: When do you think something will happen? 

RAY: Soon. Soon. 

BILLY: Good. My guy's ready to come see you. We just need to know when. 

RAY: I can call my guy in Colombia and then call you back. Will that be fine? 

BILLY: Yeah, I'll wait to hear from you. Thanks, my friend. 

RAY: I'll talk to you soon.
