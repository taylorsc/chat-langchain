RAY:  Hello. 

BENNY: Hey, Ben. Bill's brother? 

RAY: Yes, yes. How are you, my friend? 

BENNY: Oh, muy bien, muy bien. Listen, I'm with Freddy, and he's our guy who's gonna meet you. He'll be headed down south tomorrow. 

RAY: No, no. That's too soon. I haven't even left Florida yet. 

BENNY: Yeah, I know, but our guy's driving, and it'll take him a while to get there. 

RAY: I don't want no pressure with your guy waiting on me. 

BENNY: Look, don't worry about that. What we're worried about is waiting. We just want him there when you get back, because we need our stuff fast. 

RAY:  Wait, and send him the day after. 

BENNY: Are you going to Colombia tomorrow, or not? 

RAY: That is the plan. 

BENNY: Then he's leaving tomorrow. He'll be there when you get back. 

RAY: Okay, bye. 

BENNY: Bye.
