KENZIE: Hello?

OWEN: Hi, Kenzie. 

KENZIE: Hi, Owen. Uh, things okay? 

OWEN: Not really. Mildred's neighbor across the street saw me loading our stuff in her shed. He asked me what I was doing and yelled that he was gonna call the cops. 

KENZIE: Oh, no. 

OWEN: Yeah. I told him we had a contract with Mildred and pointed at the sign. 

KENZIE: Well, that was good. Did he back off then? 

OWEN: No. He said I had no business in her shed. 

KENZIE: Did you tell him we had her permission? 

OWEN: Yes. I gave him your card and told him to call you. 

KENZIE: Oh, hopefully he calls me first and not the cops. 

OWEN:  Yeah. 

KENZIE: Okay, I better keep this line open. 

OWEN: Okay, bye.
