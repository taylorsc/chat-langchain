KERI:  Eagle's Maintenance and Landscaping. 

BENNY: Hi, you heard from Bill? 

KERI: Good morning to you too. 

BENNY: Oh, yeah, good morning. 

KERI: Not yet, but I'm sure I will. 

BENNY: Okay, well I've got to do some banking later today, so I'll need you to transfer some funds from various accounts. 

KERI: How much? 

BENNY: Get me about $50 all totaled, keeping each transfer amount under $10. 

KERI: Geez, why don't you guys ever spread this out over days, making it simpler? 

BENNY: I'm getting the majority of the money from the safe, so that is making it simpler. 

KERI:  Yeah, for you. Okay, I'll handle it. 

BENNY: Alright. I should be there in a bit. I'll stop and get donuts. 

KERI: Hey, thanks. Hey, how'd you do last night? 

BENNY: On what? 

KERI: The game. 

BENNY: I won. And you? 

KERI: I lost, but not much. 

BENNY: How'd you lose? 

KERI: I decided to take a gamble and go against the odds. Women's intuition. Last time, I'll listen to it. 

BENNY: You silly girl. Okay, well, I'll see you in a bit. 

KERI: Okay, bye.
