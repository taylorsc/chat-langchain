KERI:  Eagles Maintenance and Landscaping. 

BILLY: Where's Benny? 

KERI: I thought he was with you. 

BILLY: He was up until about 10 minutes ago. 

KERI: You want me to try? 

BILLY: Yeah, tell him Freddy can't meet him in Ted until 7. 

KERI: Okay, I thought you and Benny were meeting with Freddy. 

BILLY: Well, I was. I had to cancel though, so now they're going to meet at Benny's. I just talked to Freddy though, he can't make it back from Porter until 7. Benny thought they were meeting at 6, so I need to tell him. 

KERI: Okay, I'll call him. 

BILLY: Bueno, bye.
