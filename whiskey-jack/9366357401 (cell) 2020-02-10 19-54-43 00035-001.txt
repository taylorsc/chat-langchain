BILLY:  Hello? 

BENNY: Hey, we got Freddy all lined out, and I think we're set to go. 

BILLY: Okay, what's the deal? 

BENNY: Well, I figure we can leave about noon. Ted's gonna cover Freddy's crew, and we drew Freddy a map. Got him set on his route. I'm gonna go to the bank in the morning and get the money. 

BILLY: You better pull the money from several accounts. 

BENNY: I know, I know, this ain't my first rodeo. 

BILLY: I just don't want you forgetting. 

BENNY: I won't. In fact, I'll have to get carried to transfer some funds from various accounts so I can pull some money. Got quite a bit in the safe, and we'll use that, but we'll still need some more. 

BILLY:  Yeah, since we don't know the actual amount, we'll have to send Fred with more than enough. 

BENNY: Exactly. Anyway, that's it. Looks like it's a deal. It's a deal. 

BILLY: Okay, I'll see you manana about 6.30. Bueno, bye.
