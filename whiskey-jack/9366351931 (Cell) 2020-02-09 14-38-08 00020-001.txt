KERI:  Eagles Maintenance and Landscaping. 

BILLY: Hey Keri, I forgot to tell you to call that nursery in South Florida that we've used before and make arrangements to buy a couple of Sago palms. 

KERI: Okay, do you remember the name of it? 

BILLY: No, that's what you're for. 

KERI: Yeah, right. Remember, you get what you pay for. 

BILLY: I think you've got that backwards. I'm paying for the kind of service I get. 

KERI: Whatever. 

BILLY: You know who I'm talking about. We used them several weeks ago. 

KERI: I remember. Last time Freddy went and got your stuff, it was more like a month ago. 

BILLY: Hey, easy, easy. You never know who's got big ears. 

KERI: You're so paranoid.  Okay, I'll look him up. How many do you want to buy and when? 

BILLY: Buy about two, that should be enough. 

KERI: Okay, when? 

BILLY: I don't know, should be the next three or four days or so. 

KERI: Okay, I'll call and place an order. 

BILLY: Bueno, bye. Oh, oh, I'm working from home now, watching Caleb if anyone needs anything. 

KERI: Okay, bye. 

BILLY: Bye.
