KERI:  Hey, what are you doing? 

FRED: Working my ass off trying to finish up. I have to get back there by seven. 

KERI: Okay, well I won't keep you. Mrs. Dommel just called and she wants to know if you can bring some potted plants when you go to her yard. Who? What? Mrs. Dommel. She lives in Champions Forest and she's scheduled for maintenance Friday morning. 

FRED: Oh, okay. 

KERI: She's having a party Friday night and she just wants a little something extra to dress up her yard. 

FRED: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Did she say what exactly she wants? 

KERI: No, apparently she's going to leave that up to us. 

FRED: Okay, just make sure you leave a note on the work order for her yard for Friday morning.  and we'll make sure to grab some plants from the nursery to take with us. 

KERI: Okay, sounds good. 

FRED: Oh, hey, come to think of it, I might not be here as I'm on standby to go down south to pick up, uh... to pick up, uh... Yeah, I know. 

KERI: Well, if you're not here, then Benny will probably cover your crew, and he'll see the note. 

FRED: Right, right. Okay, it works for me. I gotta go. 

KERI: Wait! I just wanted to remind you that tonight's the big night. 

FRED: Meaning what? 

KERI: The game! 

FRED: Oh, yeah. 

KERI: Ted came by early this morning, and I called Vegas and got the line and everything, and then we called Boogie and made our bets. 

FRED: Yeah, I'm gonna do that later today. 

KERI:  You want the info? 

FRED: Nope, too busy right now. I'll get it later. I have to go. 

KERI: Okay, bye.
