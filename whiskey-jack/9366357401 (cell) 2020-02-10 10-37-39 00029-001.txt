BENNY:  Hello. 

KERI: Hey, Benny. Billy just called and said that Freddy can't get back from Porter till 7. So just let you know. 

BENNY: Okay, that's fine. Did you call Ted? 

KERI: No, no one asked me to, but I will. 

BENNY: No, don't worry about it. I'll do it because I need to talk to him anyway. 

KERI: Okay. 

BENNY: Okay. Is that all? 

KERI: Yep. 

BENNY: Okay, bye. Bye.
