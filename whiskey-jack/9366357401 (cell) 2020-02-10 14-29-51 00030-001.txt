TED:  Hello? 

BENNY: Hey, Freddy can't meet us till 7. 

TED: Why? 

BENNY: He's in Porter, can't get back till then. 

TED: Damn! 

BENNY: What? 

TED: Nothing. It's just my show comes on at 7, I didn't want to miss it. 

BENNY: What show? 

TED: Survivor. 

BENNY: Damn, Ted, what's more important? 

TED: I know, I know. I didn't say what was more important. I just said I hate to miss it. 

BENNY: Well, suck it up, Alice. You wanna go get a burger and beer before we come back here? 

TED: That'll be good. I'll meet you at Henry's hideout at 6. 

BENNY: Sounds good to me. Bye. Bye.
