BENNY: Hello? 

BILLY: Hi. Listen, I called Ray and he said he'll call his guy in Columbia and then call me back. 

BENNY: Good. 

BILLY: Yeah, he's ready to do the deal, man. He said he's anxious, too. 

BENNY: Yeah, I've been thinking we might oughta start using that guy in Miami more. He always seems to come through when we need him to. Ray seems to always string us along. 

BILLY: Hey, don't switch gears in midstream. Let's just wait till we hear back from Ray. 

BENNY: Okay, call me as soon as you hear from him. Bye. 

BILLY: I will. Bye.
